# Tips
* Every time you create a new region, it selects a random color for it. You can manually specify a color by clicking its color icon on the side bar, or re-roll the color by right clicking it and selecting reset color
* You can click the eye icon on the regions to toggle it's visibility. 
* if you create a large region (e.g., around seattle) and zoom in, if you cannot see an edge of the region, it hides the region's map shading.
* When the eye icon on the region is grey, it means the region is not visible on the screen. You are either zoomed in and unable to see the region's edge, or it is not on the screen.
